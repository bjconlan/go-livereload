WHY?

base64, sha1, uuid (all required for websockets), clean threading and
event system and finally a nice file monitoring abstraction.

Yes most of these are available in c/c++ libraries via openssl, glib and
libuv. But these are hindered by either licensing issues (I want this to
be a simple 'tight static binary' aka, a stripped single file).

Go ticks all boxes and has these features out of the box. (luajit/libuv aka
luvit a close second)

It's only when you look at what is out there that you realized how good 
what you've got is. So to the Java developers and the amazing work everyone
in that community has done over the last 10 odd years THANK YOU. To all the
opensource project contributors THANK YOU! (not to mention the go(ogle) team,
Trolltech/Nokia (please make qt.core bsd/apache licensed one of these days)
and of course the glib/Gnome guys, oh and also Apple CF(lite) is something
that should get more attention outside of osx development)

Oh and to compile this you will probably have to install go (and have it's
toolchain available in your path. on osx `brew install go` does a good job
of this.
